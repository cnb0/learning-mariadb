Code examples are executed on MariaDB 10.0.6 on Debian Linux 7.3.
I installed MariaDB from generic Linux binaries as documented here:
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/installing-mariadb-binary-tarballs/

My code examples in the book include:
* MariaDB prompt and the statements to enter
* MariaDB's output

Each example file in this archive only includes the SQL statements to be executed.

To reproduce them, just start the "mysql" command-line client and paste the statements.
(even when there is more than 1 statements, just paste and hit enter)

In some cases, something must be done to prepare the code example (create a table, etc).
In that case, in the file you will find:
* "Before trying the code:"
* "Code:"

Note that in some cases, the book reports an example output, but it is impossible to
obtain exactly the same output when executing it (for example, when threads information is showed).
