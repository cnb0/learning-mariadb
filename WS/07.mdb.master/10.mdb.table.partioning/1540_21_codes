Note:

Replace /disk_x with a path which really exists on your computer
and for which 'mysql' user has full rights.
/tmp should be ok

SQL:

CREATE TABLE employee (
	id INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
)
ENGINE = InnoDB
PARTITION BY RANGE (id) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (10000)
	DATA DIRECTORY '/disk_x',
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
