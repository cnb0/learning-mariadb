1)

Create a file called notify.sh:

#!/bin/sh -eu
while [ $# -gt 0 ]
do
	case $1 in
	--primary)
		[ "$2" != "yes" ]
		echo "Node1 is not in a primary cluster anymore!"> $EMAILMESSAGE
		/bin/mail -s "Galera Problem" "some.valid@mail.com" < $EMAILMESSAGE
		shift
		;;
	esac
	shift
done

2)

In Galera, execute:

SET @@global.wsrep_notify_cmd = '/path/to/notify.sh';

Adjust the path to notify.sh

3)

Testing the script itself is not easy. I suggest you simply call it from the command line,
because this is enough to verify that the script is correct.
The "clean" alternative is that you setup a cluster of 4 nodes, and then you disconnect
2 of them using the killall Linux command.
