NOTE:
This example requires that a table called customers_non_comp exists.
I used a big table. I don't really think that it is necessary to send that big file to testers.
They can repeat this test after generating a customers_non_comp table (the structure/data do no matter),
their work will be faster.
But of course I could send the big file, if they think it is necessary...


Code:

CREATE TABLE test.customers_16 ENGINE=InnoDB ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=16 SELECT * FROM test.customers_non_comp;
CREATE TABLE test.customers_8 ENGINE=InnoDB ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8 SELECT * FROM test.customers_non_comp;
CREATE TABLE test.customers_4 ENGINE=InnoDB ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=4 SELECT * FROM test.customers_non_comp;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test.customers_16; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test.customers_8; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test.customers_4; 
SELECT * FROM INNODB_CMPMEM_RESET;
