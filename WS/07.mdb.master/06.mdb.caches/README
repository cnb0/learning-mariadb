Code examples are executed on MariaDB 10.0.9 on Debian Linux 7.3.
I installed MariaDB from generic Linux binaries as documented here:
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/installing-mariadb-binary-tarballs/
In the directory:
/usr/local/mysql

Most examples require that the user is logged into MariaDB as root.

SQL examples in the book include:
* MariaDB prompt and the statements to enter
* MariaDB's output

Each example file in this archive includes the SQL statements to be executed.

To reproduce SQL statements, just start the "mysql" command-line client and paste the statements.
(even when there is more than 1 statements, just paste and hit enter)

In some cases, something must be done to prepare the code example (create a table, etc).
In that case, in the file you will find "Before trying the code:"

NOTE: execute the tests in their order. Some tests require that
another test has been executed.

BEFORE trying the tests, execute this (only once):

USE test;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS myisam1, myisam2;
CREATE TABLE `myisam1` (
  `a` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `b2` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`a`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
/*!50100 PARTITION BY KEY (a)
PARTITIONS 3 */;
CREATE TABLE `myisam2` (
  `a` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `b` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`a`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
/*!50100 PARTITION BY KEY (a)
PARTITIONS 3 */;
