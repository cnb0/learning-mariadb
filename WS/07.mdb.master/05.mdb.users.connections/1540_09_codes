Test this after example 8 (you need the SSL keys and certificate).

Stop MariaDB.
Add the following lines to the usr/local/mysql/data/my.cnf file, in the [mysqld] section:

# SSL 
ssl-ca=/etc/ssl/mysql/ca-cert.pem
ssl-cert=/etc/ssl/mysql/server-cert.pem
ssl-key=/etc/ssl/mysql/server-key.pem

...and check that MariaDB starts.
After testing this example, erase these lines and restart MariaDB.
