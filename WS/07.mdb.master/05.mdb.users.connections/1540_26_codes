This example must be executed on 2 different mysql command-line clients.

Console1:

DO SLEEP(2000);

Console2:

SHOW PROCESSLIST;
KILL QUERY 9;

NOTE: The output of SHOW PROCESSLIST is not expected to be IDENTICAL to the one I've written
in the book, but one line should be very similar. Replace "9" with the ID value of that line.
