Code examples are executed on MariaDB 10.0.8 on Debian Linux 7.3.
I installed MariaDB from generic Linux binaries as documented here:
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/installing-mariadb-binary-tarballs/
In the directory:
/usr/local/mysql

Most examples require that the user is logged into MariaDB as root.

SQL examples in the book include:
* MariaDB prompt and the statements to enter
* MariaDB's output

Each example file in this archive includes the SQL statements to be executed.

To reproduce SQL statements, just start the "mysql" command-line client and paste the statements.
(even when there is more than 1 statements, just paste and hit enter)

Some examples must be executed on 2 different consoles, to show concurrency mechanisms.
In this case, before each SQL set of statements, there is a line indicating if the SQL
must be executed on Console1 or Console2.

In some cases, something must be done to prepare the code example (create a table, etc).
In that case, in the file you will find "Before trying the code:"
