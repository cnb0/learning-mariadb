Note:
Replace "federico" with your Linux user.

Before trying the code:

INSTALL SONAME 'auth_socket';

Code:

CREATE USER federico IDENTIFIED VIA `mysql_native_password`;
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO federico IDENTIFIED VIA `unix_socket`;
CREATE USER federico IDENTIFIED VIA `mysql_native_password`;
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO federico IDENTIFIED VIA `unix_socket`;
