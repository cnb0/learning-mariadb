SELECT CURRENT_USER(), USER();

Note:
This is not expected to return the same results I've written in the book,
unless the computer is called "mandarino" and the proper accounts are created...
I suggest that the testers just understands the meaning of these functions
and check that the query shows what I wanted to show, to make life easier.
