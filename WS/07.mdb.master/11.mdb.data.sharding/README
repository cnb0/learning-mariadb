Code examples are executed on MariaDB 10.0.11 on Debian Linux 7.3.
I installed MariaDB from generic Linux binaries as documented here:
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/installing-mariadb-binary-tarballs/
In the directory:
/usr/local/mysql

SQL examples in the book include:
* MariaDB prompt and the statements to enter
* MariaDB's output

Each example file in this archive includes the SQL statements to be executed.

Some of these examples require to be executed in 2 servers.
Use 1 server as "local" and 1 server as "remote". When not specified, execute
examples on Local - they could create objects that are needed in the following examples.

If you don't have 2 physical machines, you can:
* use a virtual machine (I use Virtual Box)
* or install multiple MariaDB instances using SandBox: http://mysqlsandbox.net/

I think that the testers know how to do this, but I can assist them if needed.
