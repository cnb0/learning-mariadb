Note:

The following example requires that there is a long-running query active in another session.
In the book, the query is:
SELECT a, b FROM t WHERE a = 1 ORDER BY a DESC
If you don't want to populate a huge table, just execute something like SELECT SLEEP(300);
which makes the connection just be active for 5 minutes.
Replace 37 with the id of the session which is running the query
(column ID in the output of SHOW PROCESSLIST).

SQL:

SHOW PROCESSLIST \G
SHOW EXPLAIN FOR 37 \G
SHOW WARNINGS;
SHOW EXPLAIN FOR 37 \G
