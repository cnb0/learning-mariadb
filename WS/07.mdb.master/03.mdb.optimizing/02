before trying the example:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE t (
	col1 VARCHAR(255),
	col2 VARCHAR(255),
	INDEX idx (col1, col2)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;

just check that the following queries work...

SELECT * FROM t WHERE col1 LIKE 'begin%';
SELECT * FROM t WHERE col1 LIKE '%end';
SELECT * FROM t WHERE col1 = 10;
SELECT * FROM t WHERE col2 = 10;
SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY col1, col2;
SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY col2, col1;
