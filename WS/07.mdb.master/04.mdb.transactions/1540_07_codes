Console1:

CREATE TABLE t (a INT) ENGINE = Aria;
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1);

Console2:

RENAME TABLE t TO tab;

Console3:

SELECT * FROM information_schema.METADATA_LOCK_INFO \G

Note: the output should be identical to the output that appears in the book,
but the THREAD_ID values will probably be different, and i think that the
order of results may vary too. It's ok: the order has no meaning for the user.

Console1:

SELECT * FROM t;
COMMIT;
SELECT * FROM t;

Note: an error is expected after last query!
