This test is very similar to the previous one, but it must be run on Windows (I tried it on 7, but any version should be ok)
Create the files maria.log.01, maria.log.02, maria.log.03 in any directory, open the command prompt, move to the directory, and just check that the following commands work:

del maria.log.03
rename maria.log.02 maria.log.03 
rename maria.log.01 maria.log.02 
dir maria.log.*
