Before the code:
* add this line to /usr/local/mysql/my.cnf:
base_dir=/usr/local/mysql
* try to start MariaDB (it will fail, but it's ok)

shell:
sudo tail -20 /usr/local/mysql/data/this.err | grep ERROR

After the code:
Drop the line you added to /usr/local/mysql/my.cnf, or the server will not start again.
