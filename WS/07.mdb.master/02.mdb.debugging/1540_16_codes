Before the code:
to test this example, MariaDB must be started with these options:
mysqld --general-log --log-output=table,file

NOTE: you can only check that this query works. The results depend on what you did before it

sql:
SELECT user_host, event_time, argument
	FROM mysql.general_log
	WHERE
		event_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 WEEK
		AND command_type = 'Query'
		AND argument LIKE '%drop%table%orders\_history%'
	ORDER BY event_time DESC
	LIMIT 20;
