Before the code:
to test this example, MariaDB must be started with these options:
mysqld --general-log --log-output=table,file

NOTE:
you can only check that this query works. The results depend on what you did before it

sql:
SELECT event_time, command_type, argument
	FROM mysql.general_log
	WHERE thread_id = 100
	AND event_time > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
	ORDER BY event_time \G
