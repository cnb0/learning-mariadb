Code examples are executed on MariaDB 10.0.7 on Debian Linux 7.3.
Bash shell is used (default on Debian).
I installed MariaDB from generic Linux binaries as documented here:
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/installing-mariadb-binary-tarballs/
In the directory:
/usr/local/mysql

Always execute shell commands as root (run "sudo -i").

SQL examples in the book include:
* MariaDB prompt and the statements to enter
* MariaDB's output

Shell examples include:
* Bash prompt + commands
* Bash output
, or only the commands, when I thought that including the output was not important.

Each example file in this archive includes the SQL statements to be executed.
Before the commands, there is a line which indicates if the example must be tried
in MariaDB or in the Debian's command line ("sql" or "shell").

To reproduce SQL statements, just start the "mysql" command-line client and paste the statements.
(even when there is more than 1 statements, just paste and hit enter)
To reproduce shell examples, do the same on a command line console.

In some cases, something must be done to prepare the code example (create a table, etc).
In that case, in the file you will find "Before trying the code:"

Note that in some cases, the book reports an example output, but it is impossible to
obtain exactly the same output when executing it (for example, when threads information is showed).
